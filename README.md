This is a Project of mine which i learned from academind i have changed many things like added a content loader and customized the content Loader.
Also the delivery menu is just new instead of adding it to the bottom.
Also i have added a input hook which checks all the input when you are placing an order.
This should be the base and you can integrate Cloud Firestore if you like if you are really serious about this app.
Also integrating stripe was an idea.

Anyone and everyone is free to use this as they like.
